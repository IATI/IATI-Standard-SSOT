Organisation Registration Agency
================================



The values from this codelist are used to identify the particular list that an organisation identifier was drawn from. The codelist provides a register of known identifier lists, including national company registers, NGO directories and international and multilateral organisation lists - along with guidance and online resources to help locate the identifiers assigned to a specific organisation.

As of 17 July 2017 this list is maintained by the org-id.guide project. Data publishers can now search for and locate the relevant list for a particular organisation identifier using the `org-id.guide website <http://org-id.guide/>`__. The full register of identifier sources is also available to download in `XML <http://org-id.guide/download.xml>`__, `JSON <http://org-id.guide/download.json>`__ and `CSV <http://org-id.guide/download.csv>`__ formats.

IATI periodically replicates the codelist of identifier sources from org-id.guide, to assist those accessing IATI documentation. However, it is advised that the most up-to-date source is the `org-id.guide project <http://org-id.guide/>`__.

If org-id.guide does not contain an entry for the kind of organisation you need to identify, you can make a request a new list is included in the register following the `guidance <http://docs.org-id.guide/en/latest/contribute/>`__ or by getting in touch with org-id.guide at: contact@org-id.guide.






This is a :ref:`Replicated codelist <non_core_codelist>`.

This 9 digit number will be requested by all French administration when dealing with you.. It is a proof that you are a fully registered French business" [1] "The SIRET code/number is an INSEE code which allows the geographic identification of any French establishment or business. The 14-digit number consists of three parts: - first, the SIREN code of the business (or legal unit or person) that owns the unit represented by the SIRET code, - second, the NIC (French: Numéro interne de classement), is a sequential four-digit number unique to the establishment, - and finally, a check digit that verifies the entire SIRET number. For example, 732 829 320 00074 would refer to the seventh establishment of the business with SIREN number 732 829 320."

     - Employer Identification Number - Internal Revenue Service
     - The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assigns companies an Employer Identification Number (EIN) upon application. However, not all corporate entities are required to have an EIN. For tax-exempt entities (non-profits, charities etc.) the IRS maintains a list of EINs. Public listed company EINs are available via the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other EINs may be available by asking the organisation concerned, and are sometimes published on their websites. "An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and is used to identify a business entity. Generally, businesses need an EIN. " [1] "An employer identification number (EIN), also called a tax ID number or taxpayer ID, is required for most business entities... A tax ID number is not required if you operate a sole proprietorship or an LLC with no employees, in which case you would simply use your own Social Security Number as a tax ID." [2] "In the US, corporate registration happens at the state level. The timeliness, availability, and licensing of this data varies among all 50 states. There is no federal dataset that contains all corporate registrations. It would be possible to create a unified open registry for all US corporations (even if only via aggregation from state ones) but this does not exist at this time. Across those states performance varies widely and in many cases data is not available in bulk, is not machine readable, is not openly licensed etc. For more detail, see the per state summary on Open Corporates." [3] "The Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number, is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. When the number is used for identification rather than employment tax reporting, it is usually referred to as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and when used for the purposes of reporting employment taxes, it is usually referred to as an EIN.

To construct an identifier: For NUTS 2 and 3 codes, use the prefix (XR-NUTS-) and then the NUTS code provided.

No searchable database of PBOs has been found. "The mere fact that an organisation has a non-profit motive or is established or registered as an NPO registered under the NPO Act, or is established as an NPC, does not mean that it automatically qualifies for preferential tax treatment or approval as a PBO. An organisation will enjoy preferential tax treatment only after it has applied for and been granted approval as a PBO by the Commissioner, and continues to comply with the relevant prescribed requirements.
