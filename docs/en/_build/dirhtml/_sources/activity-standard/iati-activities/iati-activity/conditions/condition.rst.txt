Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

2.01
^^^^
Freetext is no longer allowed with this element.  It should `now be declared <http://iatistandard.org/upgrades/integer-upgrade-to-2-01/2-01-changes/#narrative-new-elements>`__  with the new child ``narrative`` element.

1.04
^^^^
| It was always the intention of the standard that a condition could be specified in different languages but the schema has never allowed it.
| This has now been fixed.
