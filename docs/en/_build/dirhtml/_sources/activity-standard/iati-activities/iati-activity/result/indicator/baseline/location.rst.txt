This is the reference page for the XML element ``location``. 

.. index::
  single: location

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~


A location already defined and described in the iati-activity/location element.


Rules
~~~~~








This element may occur any number of times.







Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~


.. _iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/baseline/location/.ref:

@ref
  A cross-reference to the internal reference assigned to a defined location: iati-activity/location/\@ref.


  This value must be of type xsd:string.



  





Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example of ``location`` in context of a ``baseline`` element (as part of a parent ``result``/``indicator`` element).

| This example declares ``@ref`` as *AF-KAN*, which matches the ``@ref`` value for a location already referenced in iati-activity/location:

.. code-block:: xml

    <location ref="AF-KAN" />


| The ``location`` element can be repeated within any ``actual`` element:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../activity-standard-example-annotated.xml
	:language: xml
	:start-after: <!--result-baseline starts-->
	:end-before: <!--result-baseline ends-->
