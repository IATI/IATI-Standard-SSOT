=================

``iati-activities/iati-activity/recipient-country``

This is the reference page for the XML element ``recipient-country``. 

.. index::
  single: recipient-country

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~


A country that will benefit from this activity. If a specific
country is not known the recipient-region element should be
used instead. For geographical location, use the location
element.

Multiple countries and regions can be reported, in which case
the percentage attribute MUST be used to specify the share of
total commitments across all reported countries and regions.

The country can also be specified at transaction rather than
activity level. If recipient-country OR recipient-region are
reported at the transaction level, ALL transactions MUST
contain a recipient-country or recipient-region element and
iati-activity/recipient-country
and iati-activity/recipient-region MUST NOT be used.


Rules
~~~~~








This element may occur any number of times.

Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example ``recipient-country`` of an ``iati-activity``.

| The ``@code`` attribute declares a valid code (*AF*) from the *Country* codelist.

.. code-block:: xml

        <recipient-country code="AF" />

| The ``recipient-country`` element can be repeated in any ``iati-activity``.
| When multiple ``recipient-country`` are declared, then the ``@percentage`` values should sum to 100% for the specific ``iati-activity``:

.. code-block:: xml

	<recipient-country code="AF" percentage="50" />
	<recipient-country code="AG" percentage="50" />

| When both the ``recipient-region`` and ``recipient-country`` are declared, then the ``@percentage`` values should sum to 100% per region vocabulary for the specific ``iati-activity``.

.. code-block:: xml

	<recipient-country code="AF" percentage="50" />
	<recipient-region code="489" vocabulary="1" percentage="50" />
	<recipient-region code="A1" vocabulary="99" percentage="50" vocabulary-uri="http://example.com/vocab.html" />
