Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example ``location`` for an ``iati-activity``.

| This element is a parent for other child elements.

| An example organisation ``@ref`` of *AF-KAN* is declared.

.. code-block:: xml

	<location ref="AF-KAN">
	...
	</location>

| Full example with all child elements:

.. literalinclude:: ../../activity-standard-example-annotated.xml
	:language: xml
	:start-after: <!--location-single starts-->
	:end-before: <!--location-single ends-->

| The ``location`` element can be repeated in any ``iati-activity``:

.. code-block:: xml

	<location ref="AF-KAN">
	...
	</location>
	<location ref="KH-PNH">
	...
	</location>

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~
2.01
^^^^
The following child elements were removed: `coordinates; gazetteer-entry; location-type <http://iatistandard.org/upgrades/integer-upgrade-to-2-01/2-01-changes/#location-removed-elements>`__.

The @percentage attribute was `removed <http://iatistandard.org/upgrades/integer-upgrade-to-2-01/2-01-changes/#location-removed-attributes>`__.

1.04
^^^^
Note that major changes were made to the subelements of ``location`` in version 1.04.

| For more information refer to:

* the `1.04 location changes overview guidance <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/upgrades/upgrade-changelogs/v1-upgrades/decimal-upgrade-to-1-04/location-summary/>`__
* the `Activities Schema Changelog <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/upgrades/upgrade-changelogs/v1-upgrades/decimal-upgrade-to-1-04/1-04-changes/>`__ (or the individual subemelement pages)

| The @ref attribute was introduced to provide a cross reference that a publisher can use to link back to their own internal system.
| The @percentage attribute was deemed unworkable and deprecated in 1.04


1.03
^^^^
Where used, the @percentage attribute is now designated as a decimal
value and no longer as a positive Integer
