Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example usage of ``location-id`` within a ``location`` of an ``iati-activity``..

| The ``@vocabulary`` attribute declares a valid code (*G1*) from the *GeographicVocabulary* codelist.
| An example value of *1453782* from that vocabulary is declared in the ``@code`` attribute.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../activity-standard-example-annotated.xml
	:language: xml
	:start-after: <!--location-single starts-->
	:end-before: <!--location-single ends-->

Note: If the *GeographicVocabulary* *G2* (*Open Street Map*) is used, then the ``@code`` value should be of the form <OSM element>/<OSM identifier>

The OSM element will be a node, way or relation.

| Examples:

* node/1234567
* way/1234567
* relation/1234567

.. code-block:: xml
