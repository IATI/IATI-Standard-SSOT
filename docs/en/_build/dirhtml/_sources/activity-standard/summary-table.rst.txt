      - A date/time stamp for when this file was generated. This
        is not necessarily the last-updated date for the
        individual activity records in it. Use of this attribute
        is highly recommended, to allow recipients to know when a

      - linked-data-default
      - If a publisher chooses to publish linked data about their
        IATI activities then allowing them to declare where this
        data is published would support discovery of it, and any
        additional information they may choose to publish as
        Linked Data alongside it.
        
        This attribute is a URI path upon which an activity
        identifier can be appended to get a differentiable URI
        for any activity contained within a file.
        
        Where a publisher declares using one of these properties
        that authoritative linked data is accessible for an
        activity then consuming applications that are generating
        Linked Data from an IATI XML file should assert an
        owl:sameAs relationship to the relevant URI.

        activity identifier. The prefix and the suffix should be

It is also recommended that if a publisher has its own classification system or systems then the vocabularies 99 or 98 (Reporting Organisation's own vocabularies) should be used in addition to DAC codes.
        
        Publishers using 98 or 99 must also include a narrative in the narrative element.
        
        Note that if multiple sector codes are used in multiple vocabularies, then each vocabulary’s percentages should add up to 100.
        
        Sector can also be reported at the transaction level rather than the activity level. Sector must only be reported at EITHER transaction level OR activity level.
