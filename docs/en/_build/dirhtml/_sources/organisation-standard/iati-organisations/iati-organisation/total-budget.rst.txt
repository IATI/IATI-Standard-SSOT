Definition
~~~~~~~~~~


The total-budget element allows for the reporting of the organisation's
own budget. The recommendation is that, where and when possible, the
organisation's total annual planned budget for each of the next three
years is reported. The status explains whether the budget being reported
is indicative or has been formally committed. The value should appear
within the BudgetStatus codelist. If the @status attribute is not present,
the budget is assumed to be indicative.
