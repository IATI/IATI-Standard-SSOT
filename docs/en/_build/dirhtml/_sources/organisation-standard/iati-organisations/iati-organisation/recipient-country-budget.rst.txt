This is the reference page for the XML element ``recipient-country-budget``. 

.. index::
  single: recipient-country-budget

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~


The recipient-country-budget element allows for the reporting of
forward looking budgets for each country in which the organisation
operates. The recommendation is that, where and when possible, the
organisation's total annual planned budget for each of the next
three financial years is reported for each recipient country.
It is strongly recommended that the start and end of the reported
financial years match those of the recipient country's
budgetary/planning cycle. The status explains whether the budget
being reported is indicative or has been formally committed. The
value should appear within the BudgetStatus codelist. If the
@status attribute is not present, the budget is assumed to be
indicative.
