This is the reference page for the XML element ``recipient-org-budget``. 

.. index::
  single: recipient-org-budget

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~


The recipient-org-budget element allows for the reporting of
forward looking budgets for each institution which receives
core funding from the reporting organisation. The
recommendation is that, where and when possible, annual
planned budgets for each recipient institution for each of the
next three financial years are reported. This is primarily
applicable to donors but any provider of core funding is
expected to use it. Earmarked budgets should be reported at
activity-level through the Activity Standard. The status
explains whether the budget being reported is indicative or
has been formally committed. The value should appear within
the BudgetStatus codelist. If the @status attribute is not
present, the budget is assumed to be indicative.
