Schema

| Summary tables of the :doc:`Activity Schema <activity-standard/summary-table>` and of the :doc:`Organisation Schema <organisation-standard/summary-table>` are also available.

Core Schema
-----------
The current suite IATI XML schemas consists of the following components:

-  `iati-organisations-schema.xsd <downloads/iati-organisations-schema.xsd>`__ - XML schema for describing an organisation involved in any stage development cooperation (funding, implementing etc.).

| In addition to the *Organisation* and *Activity*. core terms are described in the following:

-  `iati-common.xsd <downloads/iati-common.xsd>`__ - A supplementary schema with common IATI markup.  Must be in the same directory as the *Organisation* and *Activity* schema.

-  `xml.xsd <downloads/xml.xsd>`__ -  A supplementary schema that must be in the same directory as the *Organisation* and *Activity* schema.
